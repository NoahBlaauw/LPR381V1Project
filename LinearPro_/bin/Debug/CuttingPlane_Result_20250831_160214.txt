Timestamp: 31/08/2025 16:02:14

Optimal Z (from tableau RHS): 15

Solution (original variables):
  X1 = 0
  X2 = 1
  X3 = 1
  X4 = 1
  X5 = 0
  X6 = 1

Note: Optimal integer solution found.

Steps:
  [CuttingPlane] Starting.
  [Fractional] Variable X5 = 0.2
  [Cut] Added Gomory cut (row 8), slack SC1, RHS -0.2.
  [DualSimplex] Pivot r8, c9 -> enter S3, leave 8.
  [DualSimplex] Feasible (no negative RHS).
  [CuttingPlane] All integer/binary variables integral. Stopping.
